# Three.js Solar System

Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the GitHub universe where I've been playing around with Three.js to create a mini solar system. It's a neat visual representation using Vite and Three.js from npm. If you're into web graphics or just curious about simulating celestial bodies in the browser, you might find this interesting.

## What's Inside?

All the magic happens in a single script where we create a solar system complete with the sun, earth, and moon, all orbiting in the vast emptiness of space. The scene is set up with lighting that mimics the sun's glow and sprinkled with stars to give it that cosmic feel. And yes, you can zoom and rotate around to explore this mini universe, thanks to the `OrbitControls`.

## Running the Project

To get this celestial show running on your local machine, you'll need to have Node.js installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies (Vite and Three.js among others).
4. Once the dependencies are installed, kick off the project with `npm run dev`.
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (your terminal may show a different port) to view the project.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this project, play around with the code, or suggest improvements. If you're new to Three.js, this might be a fun way to get your hands dirty. Dive in, explore, and let's make this solar system even more awesome together!

## Feedback

Got suggestions or feedback? Drop an issue in the repo. I'm always looking to improve and learn more about Three.js and web development in general.

Happy exploring!
